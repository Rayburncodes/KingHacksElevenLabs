Build a clean, demo-ready web app called “ClauseCast” (or “Before You Sign” if a name is required) that lets users hear the consequences of breaking a contract spoken out loud by AI.

🧠 Core Concept

Users upload or paste a contract.
They click one of three predefined scenario buttons, and the app:

Finds the relevant clause

Rewrites it in plain English

Generates a calm, professional AI voice explanation

This is a consequence simulator, not a chatbot.

🎯 MVP SCOPE (DO NOT ADD MORE)

Only support these 3 scenarios:

“If I quit early”

“If I miss a payment”

“If they terminate me”

Each response should be:

1–2 short paragraphs

Plain language (no legal jargon)

Include numbers or penalties if present

Spoken aloud using text-to-speech

🖥️ UI REQUIREMENTS

Minimal, serious, judge-friendly UI:

Title + one-line description

Contract input (paste text OR upload file)

Three large buttons (one per scenario)

Text output area (what the AI says)

Audio playback (auto-play preferred)

No chat interface.
No editing tools.
No summaries of the full contract.

🔊 VOICE

Text-to-speech API integration placeholder

Calm, neutral, professional tone

Not robotic, not dramatic

Architecture should allow plugging in ElevenLabs later

⚠️ API keys and providers will be added later — do NOT hardcode or request credentials.

🧩 LOGIC FLOW

User provides contract text

User clicks a scenario button

App:

Searches contract for relevant clauses

If exact clause not found, infer conservatively

Rewrites consequence in simple English

Pass text to a voice generation placeholder

Display text + play audio

If info is missing, say:

“This contract does not clearly specify penalties for this scenario.”

⚙️ TECH STACK (suggested but flexible)

Frontend: React

Backend: Node.js / Express

AI reasoning: LLM integration placeholder

Voice: Text-to-speech placeholder

⚠️ All external AI/voice APIs will be provided later.

🚫 HARD CONSTRAINTS

DO NOT:

Add a chat assistant

Add contract summaries

Add more scenarios

Over-engineer accuracy

Ask follow-up questions to the user

This is a 20-second demo app, not a legal product.

✅ GOAL

Produce a polished, working prototype that clearly demonstrates:

“Press a button → hear what happens if you break this contract.”

Judges should understand the value instantly.
